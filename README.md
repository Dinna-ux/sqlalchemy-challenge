Hawaii Weather Data Analysis
Overview
This project aims to analyze weather data from Hawaii, specifically focusing on precipitation and temperature measurements. The data is stored in a SQLite database (hawaii.sqlite) containing two main tables: measurement and station. Python, along with libraries like SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, is used for data retrieval, analysis, and visualization.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
Required Python libraries: SQLAlchemy, Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed.
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook file weather_analysis.ipynb.
Project Structure
Resources: Contains the SQLite database file hawaii.sqlite where weather data is stored.
weather_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis and visualization.
README.md: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions.
Data Analysis
1. Reflect Tables into SQLAlchemy ORM
Connects to the SQLite database and reflects the tables into SQLAlchemy ORM.
Assigns the Measurement and Station classes to variables for further querying.
2. Exploratory Precipitation Analysis
Retrieves the most recent date in the dataset.
Calculates the date one year prior to the most recent date.
Queries precipitation data for the last 12 months and plots the results using Matplotlib.
Calculates summary statistics for the precipitation data.
3. Exploratory Station Analysis
Calculates the total number of stations in the dataset.
Identifies the most active stations based on the number of data entries.
Calculates the lowest, highest, and average temperature for the most active station.
Queries the last 12 months of temperature observation data for the most active station and plots the results as a histogram.
4. Close Session
Closes the SQLAlchemy session.
Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the weather patterns of Hawaii, including precipitation levels and temperature variations. The analysis and visualizations can be further extended for more in-depth studies or integrated into larger applications.
